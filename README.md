# Weather Project

Project is used to extract weather information from the website  [https://weather.com/]( https://weather.com/) and using API [ https://openweathermap.org/]( https://openweathermap.org/) and compare the results.

Another variance logic is implemented to show whether results obtained from both resources are within a comparable range or not.

## Usage

From package tests, run main method of phase_three.py to see the results.
